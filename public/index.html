    <p>Founded in 1949, the National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most prominent professional basketball league that showcases the best talent from around the world. Over the course of its 75 year history, we have seen some dramatic changes in the way that basketball is played and organized at the highest level. The league that was once composed of only 11 teams has now expanded to include 30 billion-dollar franchises. All-time great players have made their mark on the NBA, where their unique play styles and personalities have altered the way that people play basketball around the world. Specifically, the NBA has rapidly changed its style both on and off the court over the last 25 years due to an ever-reformed rulebook and an increased focus on game statistics. In this article, we are aiming to convey some of the most major transformations that have taken place in the NBA in the 21st century by presenting interactive visualizations and detailed explanations of our findings.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: center">NBA Shooting: Rise of the Three-Pointer</h2>
    <p>One of the most essential aspects of NBA basketball is shooting, as that is the only way to score points for your team. Some shots are smarter than others, so over time NBA players have adapted their play style to favor shots that put their team in the best position to win games. With great deep-shooters like Steph Curry becoming more common in recent years, many believe that the NBA has transformed itself into a 3-point shooting league where most shots come from beyond the arc. I sought to determine if this was true, so I compiled playoff shot location data from the 2001 Playoffs all the way until the 2020 Playoffs to see how shot charts changed over the years. The chart below displays this information by breaking the NBA court into 15 distinct zones and labels the popularity of each one. The popularities are represented as percentages which show what percent of the total shots attempted in a given year came from that zone.</p>

    <div id="shotchart" style="margin: auto; width: fit-content">
      <div id="observablehq-viewof-curYear-e639fb10" style="margin: auto; width: 298px"></div>
      <div id="observablehq-chart-e639fb10"></div>
    </div>

    <p>The most obvious trend that can be deduced from this chart is the rise of 3-point shots coming from the right side of the court. When comparing the 2001 and 2021 playoffs, we can see that these shots more than doubled their prevalence as they went from a combined 7% popularity in 2001 to a 17% popularity in 2021. I decided to further investigate this topic by finding data on regular-season shooting averages for every year since the 2000-2001 NBA season. Specifically, I directed my attention at the “Average Percentage of FGA Coming from 3-pointers” metric. This represents what percentage of shot attempts come from 3-pointers for the average NBA player during a given season. I transformed this data into the visualization below:</p>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/inspector@5/dist/inspector.css">
    <script type="module">
    import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@5/dist/runtime.js";
    import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/d/364551627e9196c4.js?v=4";
    new Runtime().module(define, name => {
      if (name === "viewof curYear") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viewof-curYear-e639fb10"));
      if (name === "chart") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-chart-e639fb10"));
    });
    </script>
    </section>
    
    <div>
      <img src="./FPBackground.png" width="70%" style="margin-left: 15%">
    </div>

    <p>From this graph, we can see that the percentage of shots taken from beyond the arc has steadily increased from only 17% in the 2000-2001 regular season to 42.3% in the current NBA season. Something important to note is that this number increased quickly from 2012 to 2019, but seems to have tapered off at around 39% for the last several complete seasons. Based on the evidence provided in these two visualizations, we can definitely say that the percentage of three pointers attempted per game has risen dramatically over the last 25 years of NBA history.</p>

    new Runtime().module(define, name => {
      if (name === "viz") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viz-ccd2ca81"));
    });
    </script>
    </section>
    <p>Another noteworthy trend in the NBA over the past 25 years is the general increase in trades over the years, with some fluctuation. In the early 2000s, the number of trades per season was around 30, but in recent years, this number has risen significantly, with the peak being at at 67 trades during the 2014-15 season. An important trend to note is the gradual increase in trades from 2010 onward. In the above visualiation, it is clear that trade activity in the NBA has become much more frequent compared to the 2000s, reflecting the evolving dynamics of team-building strategies in professional basketball.</p>

      });

  <p>
    Over the past 20 years, the NBA has undergone significant changes, particularly in key metrics such as Pace, Field Goals Attempted (FGA), Three-Point Attempts (3PA), and Points Per Game (PPG). The league has shifted toward faster gameplay, with an increased pace resulting in more possessions per game. Teams are attempting more shots overall, with a dramatic rise in three-point attempts, reflecting the influence of analytics that emphasize the efficiency of perimeter shooting. These changes have contributed to higher scoring averages, making the modern NBA faster, more offensively oriented, and heavily reliant on three-point shooting compared to two decades ago.
